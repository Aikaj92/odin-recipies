    <h2>Enjoy a delicious pizza with your choice of toppings</h2>
    <p>Extra filling and the perfect comfort food. Easy to make with whatever's in your pantry.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients for crust</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>Yeast</li>
   <li>Sugar</li>
   <li>Bread Flour</li>
   <li>Olive oil</li>
   <li>Salt</li></ul>
   
   <h2>Steps for dough</h2>
   <ol><li>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature
    After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.</li>
<li>Prepare Your Surface With Oil
    You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.</li>
<li>Shape the Dough
    You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about â…“-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.</li>
</ol>
<h2>ingredients for sauce and whatnot</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup warm water</li>
    <li>1 package of active dry yeast</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups of bread flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
    <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
    <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
    <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
    <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
